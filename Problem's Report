We suppose that we have N containers that contain a refreshment drink.Every container has a capacity Bi ml and right now contains Ai
ml(Ai<=Bi).You are asked to make a programm that reads an integer number N (2<=N<=100000) from the user and then also read the numbers Ai
(0<=Ai<=10^9) and Bi(0<=Bi<=10^9)( for every i in (1,N) ).The programm should prints:

"Wrong Input":if there is a value that is out of limits

"Yes":if the whole quantity of the refreshment drink can be poured in any two containters 

"No":in every other situation
